## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the creation and analysis of an **Employee Database** for a fictional company, **Pewlett Hackard**, using PostgreSQL. The goal is to model, populate, and analyze employee data from the 1980s and 1990s using SQL.

Key highlights include:
- Data Modeling using an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.
- Data Engineering to create the schema and populate the database.
- Data Analysis to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries.

## **Technologies Used**

| **Tool**          | **Purpose**                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL**     | Database creation and querying    |
| **pgAdmin 4**      | Database management and queries   |
| **QuickDBD**       | Creating Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) |
| **Python (optional)** | Advanced data manipulation     |

---

## **Database Schema**

The database includes **6 tables**:

1. **employees**: Employee details such as name, gender, and hire date.
2. **departments**: Department details with unique department numbers.
3. **dept_emp**: Tracks employees assigned to departments over time.
4. **dept_manager**: Tracks department managers.
5. **salaries**: Employee salary information over time.
6. **titles**: Tracks job titles of employees over time.

## **How to Use This Repository**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/sql-challenge.git
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
- Install **PostgreSQL** and **pgAdmin 4**.
- Use **QuickDBD** to visualize the schema.

### **3. Import CSV Data**
Load the CSV files provided in the `/data` folder into the database using the `COPY` command in **pgAdmin**.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution**

### **Data Modeling**
1. **Inspect CSV Files**:
   - Examine the structure of the datasets.
2. **Create ERD**:
   - Design relationships between tables using **QuickDBD**.

### **Data Engineering**
1. **Create Database**:
   - Use **pgAdmin** to create a database named `EMPLOYEESQL`.
2. **Create Tables**:
   - Write `CREATE TABLE` SQL scripts to define schema.
3. **Load Data**:
   - Import CSV files into respective tables using the `COPY` command.

### **Data Analysis**
Run the following SQL queries:
- List employees hired in 1986.
- Identify managers by department.
- List employees in Sales and Development departments.
- Find the most common last names.

---

## **Results**

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Top Hiring Year**: Most employees were hired in 1986.
2. **Department Growth**: Sales and Development had the highest employee count.
3. **Common Last Names**: The most frequent last name was `Smith`.

### **Screenshots of Results:**
